### Process
Started my own project but eventually decided to follow a tutorial, something i wont do again. I did learn a lot about CRUD Systems and Rails with were really beneficial to my overall learning experiences, but ended up spending half the time fixing someone else's project so it could fit my needs which was helpful but not the overall goal of this project, but hey its up and running now .
